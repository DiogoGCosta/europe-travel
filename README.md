# europe-travel
Project made for a coding contest.  
The main goal of the application is to calculate the **best path between several cities**,
visiting **all** of them. Criteria for the best path can be either trip **cost**, **time** or **distance**.  

**start_city** is the index for the city where the trip starts and **dest_city** where it ends
